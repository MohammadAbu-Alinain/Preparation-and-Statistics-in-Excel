## 📊 Data Preparation and Statistical Analysis

---

## 📌 Overview

This project involves preparing, cleaning, and analyzing a dataset using Excel-based statistical methods. The goal is to assess data quality, detect anomalies, and extract meaningful patterns for further modeling or reporting. It includes data validation, outlier detection, descriptive statistics, and visualization of user interests.

The work is split across two Excel workbooks:
- **Preparation and Statistics.xlsx**: Focuses on data inspection, encoding, and detailed statistical summaries.
- **Preparation and Statistics 2.xlsx**: Highlights outlier detection and user behavior visualization.

## 📁 Files Included

### 1. **Preparation and Statistics.xlsx**

| Sheet Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `data` | The raw dataset used throughout the analysis. |
| `Check for missing data` | Identifies missing values in columns to evaluate data completeness. |
| `outliers&descriptive statistics` | Detects outliers and summarizes key statistics (mean, median, min, max, etc.). |
| `Sheet5` | Temporary or exploratory calculations (may need cleanup or clarification). |
| `encoding&descriptive statistics` | Applies categorical encoding and extends statistical summaries. |
| `Assessment of the data` | Provides an overall evaluation of the dataset’s readiness for analysis or modeling. |

---

### 2. **Preparation and Statistics 2.xlsx**

| Sheet Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `data` | The base dataset for statistical processing and visualization. |
| `Users interests chart` | A chart visualizing user interest distribution — likely based on preferences or categories. |
| `outliers` | Focused outlier detection to highlight anomalies in key numeric variables. |
| `assessment of the data` | A general review of data quality, structure, and consistency. |

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify missing or inconsistent data
- Detect outliers and anomalies in numerical fields
- Perform encoding of categorical values
- Generate statistical summaries (mean, median, mode, std, etc.)
- Visualize key insights, such as user interests or behavior patterns
- Evaluate the dataset’s quality for downstream machine learning or BI use

---

## 🧠 Methods Used

- Descriptive statistics (mean, median, min, max, std deviation)
- Outlier detection using rule-based approaches (e.g., IQR)
- Data encoding for categorical variables
- Data completeness checks
- Excel-based visualization (charts and tables)

---

## 🛠️ Tools

- **Microsoft Excel**
- **Pivot Tables**
- **Charts & Conditional Formatting**
- **Formulas and Functions** (e.g., `IF`, `ISBLANK`, `AVERAGE`, `STDEV`, etc.)

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open either Excel file in **Microsoft Excel**.
2. Navigate through the relevant sheets to inspect raw data, summaries, and visualizations.
3. Modify the data or extend analysis based on project-specific goals (e.g., regression prep, segmentation, etc.).
4. Use the `assessment` sheets to determine if data is suitable for modeling or reporting.
